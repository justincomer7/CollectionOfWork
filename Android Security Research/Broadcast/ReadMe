This was a portion of a project in which my group was tasked with discovering security flaws in interapp comunication across an 
an android platform. These this folder includes three simple apps, one that sends data, an intended reciever of that data, and a 
malicious app that will try to intercept that data. The security measures include priveleges that are provided by the android API 
and an authenticator.
